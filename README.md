# WEB322
This is the work I did for the WEB322 course at Seneca College.

This application:
  Uses multiple routes which serve static files (HTML and CSS).
  Has a "data service" module for accessing data.
  Handles file uploads and manages "employee" data.
  Includes routes and functionality to query employee data, such as fetch an employee by id, all employees by a department or manager number, etc.
  Uses the Handlebars view engine to render JSON data visually in the browser using handlebars.js views and layouts.
  Works with a Postgres data source on the server.
  Works with Client Sessions and data persistence using MongoDB to add user registration and Login/Logout functionality & tracking (logging).
  Uses "hashed" passwords.
