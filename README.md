# WEB322
This is the work I did for the WEB322 course at Seneca College.

This application:
  <br>Uses multiple routes which serve static files (HTML and CSS).
  <br>Has a "data service" module for accessing data.
  <br>Handles file uploads and manages "employee" data.
  <br>Includes routes and functionality to query employee data, such as fetch an employee by id, all employees by a department or manager number, etc.
  <br>Uses the Handlebars view engine to render JSON data visually in the browser using handlebars.js views and layouts.
  <br>Works with a Postgres data source on the server.
  <br>Works with Client Sessions and data persistence using MongoDB to add user registration and Login/Logout functionality & tracking (logging).
  <br>Uses "hashed" passwords.
